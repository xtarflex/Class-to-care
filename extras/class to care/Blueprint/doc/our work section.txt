Vision for the "Our Work" Section
Layout: A clean, visually engaging layout that breaks down their three core activities. It should feel organized and easy to understand.

Feeling: Informative, professional, and action-oriented. Each part should make the user think, "Wow, that's an important program."

Detailed Design Plan & Spec Sheet
Here are the specifications for your Canva mockup.

1. Section Container & Introduction
Background Color: White (#FFFFFF). This provides a clean canvas and contrasts with the light grey of the Impact Bar above it.

Introductory "Pill" Button: As we discussed, start the section with one of our small, light-blue "pill" buttons.

Text: Our Mission in Action
Icon: A simple target or crosshair icon.
Main Section Title (H2):

Text: "Our Work" (with the "Trustworthy Sky" gradient on the word "Work").
Font: Montserrat, Bold.
2. Layout & Content (Desktop)
Structure: A three-column layout. Each column represents one of the "Focus Areas" from the client's documents. Each column should be a self-contained "card."

Card Styling: Give each of the three columns a very subtle box-shadow and a light border to make them feel like distinct, tangible cards. A slight border-radius on the corners will soften the look.

3. Content for Each of the Three "Cards"
Card 1: Medical Education

Icon: A large GraduationCap or BookOpen icon at the top of the card.
Title (H3): "Continuous Medical Education"
Paragraph: A short, two-sentence description. We can write this using our creative control: "We empower healthcare practitioners across Nigeria with vital skills through hands-on training, workshops, and mentorship programs."
Link: A "Learn More" text link at the bottom.
Card 2: Equipment Donation

Icon: A large FirstAidKit or Heartbeat icon.
Title (H3): "Equipment Donation & Support"
Paragraph: "We identify the needs of primary health centres and donate critical medical equipment, ensuring they have the tools to provide quality care to their communities."
Link: A "Learn More" text link.
Card 3: Public Health Awareness

Icon: A large Users or Megaphone icon.
Title (H3): "Public Health Awareness"
Paragraph: "From CPR training in schools to public health screenings, we actively engage with communities to promote preventative care and life-saving knowledge."
Link: A "Learn More" text link.
4. Mobile Layout
On mobile, the three-column layout will collapse into a single column, with each of the three cards stacking vertically on top of one another.

5. Animation (On Scroll)
Effect: As the user scrolls this section into view, the three cards will animate in with a staggered effect.
Choreography: Card 1 will fade and slide in, followed by Card 2 a split-second later, and then Card 3. This creates a pleasing, dynamic entrance.
